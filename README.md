# ActiveContour2D
This repository implements greedy active contour 2D 

# Main Steps
- load the target images 
	* convert them to grey scale
	* keep them in rgb and gray scale
- Initialize contour 
	* make class contour to get position coords on mouse click on image
	* draw contours selected on the target image
	* draw lines between contour points
	* save the image with contours
	* save contour points in text file same name as its image with contour
	* load initial contour points points directly from text file
